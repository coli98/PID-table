# PID-table
The aim of the work was to design and construct a device that balances a ball placed on the table top. The device consists of a table mounted on a joint and servo drives, which, based on the position of the ball determined by the camera, deflect the table top in such a way that the ball, when placed anywhere on the table top, is moved to its center and kept in this position.
